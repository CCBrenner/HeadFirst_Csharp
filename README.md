# HeadFirst_Csharp

This repo contains all project files that I completed while going through the HeadFirst C# educational ebook. This book is what introduced me to the full language of C# programming. 

Many topics are covered in this repository. C# was the first OOP & strongly typed language that I've learned (coming from Python and JS).
This ebook encouraged the reader to do all of the projects in the book to gain experience. This seems to have been very good advice since it made me a better programmer as a result. I now have a strong foundation of knowledge in using C# to work off of.
